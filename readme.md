# STRIDE GPT

STRIDE GPT is an AI-powered threat modeling tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate threat models for a given application based on the STRIDE methodology. Users provide application details, such as the application type, authentication methods, and whether the application is internet-facing or processes sensitive data. The GPT-3 model then generates a threat model based on the provided information.
